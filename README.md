# What-is-cooking-Machine-Learning

•	Using Python implemented multiple machine learning models like SVM, Logistic regression, Random Forest to predict the Cuisine of various dishes using the lists of Ingredients used to prepare those dishes.



•	Used NLTK WordNetLemmatizer for data pre-processing and performed 80-20% split for training and testing purposes.


•	Accuracies generated from these learning models were also compared and analyzed to determine the best one.
